We present a framework for generating convex approximations of complex contact
models, incorporating experimentally validated models like Hunt \& Crossley
coupled with Coulomb's law of friction alongside the principle of maximum
dissipation. Our approach is robust across a wide range of stiffness values,
making it suitable for both compliant surfaces and rigid approximations. We
evaluate these approximations across a wide variety of test cases, detailing
properties and limitations. We implement a fully differentiable solution in the
open-source robotics toolkit, Drake. Our novel \emph{hybrid} approach enables
computation of gradients for complex geometric models while reusing
factorizations from contact resolution. We demonstrate robust simulation of
robotic tasks at interactive rates, with accurately resolved stiction and
contact transitions, supporting effective sim-to-real transfer.
