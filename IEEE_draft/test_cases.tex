\section{Test Cases}
\label{sec:results}

We analyze a series of two-dimensional cases to assess accuracy,
quantify artifacts introduced by the convex approximations, and gain
intuition into the physics and numerics.

For all cases, we use $v_s=10^{-4}\text{ m}/\text{s}$ for Lagged and Similar,
and $\sigma=10^{-3}$ for SAP, leading to very tight stiction modeling as
required for simulating manipulation tasks.

We estimate contact stiffness using Hertz theory. For a sphere of mass $m$ and
radius $R$, Hertz theory predicts a penetration
$\delta=(3mg/(4ER^{1/2}))^{2/3}$. For steel with Young's modulus $E=200\text{
GPa}$ and using the radii and masses from Sections \ref{sec:falling_sphere} and
\ref{sec:sliding_rod}, we obtain penetrations around $\delta\approx
2.5\times10^{-7}\text{ m}$ and stiffnesses $k\approx 1\times
10^{7}-2\times 10^{7}\text{ N}/\text{m}$. We use $k = 10^{7}\text{
N}/\text{m}$ for all cases in this section.

For some cases, we perform a convergence study where we compute the
error in the positions $\mf{q}_{\delta t}$ obtained using step size $\delta t$
against a reference $\mf{q}_\text{ref}$ as a function of the time step size
\begin{equation*}
    e_q(\delta t) = \left(\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T dt\Vert\mf{q}_{\delta t}(t)-\mf{q}_\text{ref}(t)\Vert^2\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation*}
where $T$ is simulation duration. The reference solution is obtained numerically
using a time step 10 times smaller than the smallest time step in the
convergence study. Since Lagged is the only approximation that is consistent
(Section \ref{sec:consistency}), we use it to compute the reference solution.
