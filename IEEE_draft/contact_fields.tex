% Paper Title: Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an,
% and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to and up, which are
% usually not capitalized unless they are the first or last word of the title.
% Linebreaks \\ can be used within to get better formatting as desired. Do not
% put math or special symbols in the title.
\title{Constrained Multibody Dynamics}

% Options:
%  - Irrotational Contact Fileds
%  - A Convex Formulation of Irrotational Contact Fields

% Author Names and IEEE memberships: Note positions of commas and nonbreaking
% spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's
% name from being broken across two lines. Use \thanks{} to gain access to the
% first footnote area a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as
% LaTeX2e's \thanks was not built to handle multiple paragraphs.

%The authors would like to thank the Dynamics \& Simulation and Large Behavior Model 
%teams at TRI for their continuous patience and support. We
%thank William Townsend and Barrett for providing us with technical
%specifications for the BarrettHand as well as advice and discussions on our
%modeling approach. We thank Cody Simpson for modeling the deformable FinRay gripper.
